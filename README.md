# TGSTL


TGSTL is a micropython application to run on the [EMF camp](https://www.emfcamp.org/) Tildagon badge as
a sound to light display using the onboard LEDs. Please note you'll need to do a bit of
soldering to get this going!! The sound detector board was designed to run of 5V so we'll need to change a resistor 
value on the PCB.

The code is a C to micropython port by Tony Goacher from 

This code ported from Michael Bartlett's C code for the Sparkfun LED visualizer (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-RGB-LED-Music-Sound-Visualizer-Arduino-Code)
to micro python by Tony Goacher (https://github.com/tonygoacher/tildagon_soundtolight)
